DGSlideViewController
=====================

This is a sliding view controller for iOS, with support for:
* Sliding from the left
* Sliding from the right
* Simple sliding animation
* Scaling while sliding
* `UIAppearance` compatible for all values, including animation durations, exposed area size, scale amount and shadow properties
* Simple accessors for changing the front view controller (with or without animation)
* Simple methods to slide in or out
* Bounces all the way to hide the current front view controller while switching to another one - this effect gives a smoother animation than other solutions
* Ready-made gesture recognizer actions (tap and pan)! Just point your gesture recognizers to these selectors.
* Status bar style handles automatically based on the visible view controller, with an option for forcing a specific status bar style. (This is all relevant only when you are in view-controller-based-status-bar mode)

This was originally in my other repository https://github.com/danielgindi/drunken-danger-zone/,
But I've finally decided to separate certain classes to separate repositories - and the major rewriting of this class was a great chance to do that!
